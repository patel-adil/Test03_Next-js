## Testing Notes:

- Verified `/api/hello` returns greeting message.
- Verified `/api/users` returns list of users.
- Verified `/api/users/[id]` returns specific user or 404 if not found.
- Used Postman to test POST requests for adding new users.
- UI correctly fetches user list from `/api/users` and displays it.

## Challenges Encountered:

- None major. Simple setup worked as expected.
- Remembered that in-memory data resets when server restarts.

## Reminder:

- `node_modules` folder is excluded from submission.
- Code is well-commented as per assignment instructions.
